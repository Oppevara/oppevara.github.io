## Assessment Rubric
#### Type: Native H5P
#### Language: English and Estonian, translatable fields in editor (and in .json)

A rubric is a criterion referenced assessment tool used to score assignments or performances. Work is scored/graded based on how well the finished product lines up with the criteria listed on the rubric. A rubric is a very powerful device for performance-based assessments, such as oral presentations or projects, but also makes grading essay questions and narratives quick and easy.

## Subject specific H5P content types

## Kekule.js
#### Type: Native H5P with 3rd party library included via CDN
#### Language: Hardcoded English only (not translatable yet, not even through semantics.json)

[Kekule.js](http://partridgejiang.github.io/Kekule.js/demos/index.html) is an open source JavaScript library for chemoinformatics released under MIT license. Currently, it is molecule-centric, focusing on providing the ability to represent, draw, edit, compare and search molecule structures on web browsers.

We embedded it in H5P packages in two ways: one allows to display static molecule structures and the other allows students to build molecules and check them against a teacher provided answer.

### Static view
