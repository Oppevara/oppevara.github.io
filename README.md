## Welcome to DigiÕppeVaramu H5P content types

Here you can find demos (and downloads to some) of the new H5P content types developed during the DigiÕppeVaramu(link?) project.

### `Assessment Rubric`
#### Type: Native H5P
#### Language: Estonian and English, translatable in editor 

A rubric is a criterion referenced assessment tool used to score assignments or performances. Work is scored/graded based on how well the finished product lines up with the criteria listed on the rubric. A rubric is a very powerful device for performance-based assessments, such as oral presentations or projects, but also makes grading essay questions and narratives quick and easy.

### `Kekule.js`
#### Type: Native H5P with 3rd party library included via CDN
#### Language: Hardcoded English only (not translatable yet, not even through semantics.json)

[Kekule.js](http://partridgejiang.github.io/Kekule.js/demos/index.html) is an open source JavaScript library for chemoinformatics released under MIT license. Currently, it is molecule-centric, focusing on providing the ability to represent, draw, edit, compare and search molecule structures on web browsers.

We embedded it in H5P packages in two ways: one allows to display static molecule structures and the other allows students to build molecules and check them against a teacher provided answer.

#### Static view
